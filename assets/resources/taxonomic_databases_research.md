# Taxonomic Databases for Original Publications and Species Descriptions

This document provides an overview of major taxonomic databases that contain original publications and species descriptions, based on research conducted for the fossil species references application.

## For Animals (Zoology)

### ZooBank (Official ICZN Registry)
- **Official registry** for all zoological nomenclature under the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN)
- **Mandatory** for electronic publications since 2012
- Contains **original descriptions** and nomenclatural acts
- **1.5+ million species** registered as of 2024
- Uses **LSIDs** (Life Science Identifiers) for unique identification
- **Pre-publication registration** required for electronic publications
- Connects to **original publication details** and bibliographic information
- **URL**: https://zoobank.org/
- **Coverage**: All animals, including fossils, though historical coverage may be incomplete

## For Plants (Botany)

### International Plant Names Index (IPNI)
- Collaboration between **Kew Gardens**, **Harvard University Herbaria**, and **Australian National Herbarium**
- Contains **nomenclatural information** (spelling, author, types, publication details)
- Covers **vascular plants** from family to infraspecific ranks
- Provides **first place/date of publication** for plant names
- **Eliminates need** to repeatedly consult primary sources for bibliographic information
- Data sources: Index Kewensis, Gray Card Index, Australian Plant Names Index, Index Filicum

### Index Nominum Genericorum (ING)
- **Generic names** for all organisms under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants
- Includes **publication dates, types, nomenclatural status**
- Feeds data into **IPNI** and **TROPICOS**
- Collaborative project between IAPT (International Association for Plant Taxonomy) and Smithsonian Institution

## For Fungi (Mycology)

### MycoBank (Primary Registration System)
- **Mandatory registration** since 2013 for valid fungal names under ICN
- **97.7%** of new fungal taxa use MycoBank for registration (as of 2021)
- **Structural links** to original publications and protologues
- Connected to **Index Fungorum**, **GBIF**, **PubMed**, and other databases
- Established in 2004 as coordination hub between repositories

### Index Fungorum
- **International project** indexing all formal fungal names
- **100,000+ names** linked to **digitized images** of original descriptions (protologues)
- **Monthly synchronization** with MycoBank and Fungal Names
- One of three nomenclatural repositories recognized by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi

### Fungal Names
- **567,000+ taxon names** from **10,000+ journals/books** published since 1596
- **147,000+ type specimen/illustration records** from 5,000+ preserving agencies
- **1+ million fungal names** with persistent publication identifiers
- Third recognized repository alongside MycoBank and Index Fungorum

## Cross-Kingdom Resources

### GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
- **Aggregates data** from multiple taxonomic databases
- Provides **unified access** to species occurrence and nomenclatural data
- Links to original descriptions through partner databases

### Catalogue of Life
- **Comprehensive checklist** of world's species
- **Links to original descriptions** through partner databases
- Integrates data from multiple taxonomic authorities

## Key Findings for Fossil Species Applications

### Most Relevant Database: ZooBank
**ZooBank would be the most relevant** for fossil species applications because:
- Covers **all animals** (including fossils)
- Maintains **direct links to original publications**
- Official registry under ICZN rules
- Uses globally unique identifiers (LSIDs)

### Limitations for Historical Species
- Paleontological species often **predate digital registration requirements**
- Coverage might be **incomplete for historical descriptions** (e.g., Weller 1905, Osborn 1905)
- Many fossil species were described before mandatory registration (pre-2012)

### Recommended Integration Strategy
For a fossil species reference application, the most practical approach would be:

1. **Query ZooBank** for species with registration records
   - Best for modern taxonomic acts and well-documented species
   - Provides direct links to original publications when available

2. **Fall back to CrossRef/BHL search** for historical papers not in ZooBank
   - Essential for pre-2012 species descriptions
   - Use taxonomic authority + year + genus for targeted searches

3. **Use PBDB DOIs** when available and no taxonomic authority mismatch exists
   - Efficient for cases where PBDB reference matches taxonomic authority
   - Avoid when mismatch detected (PBDB reference â‰  original describing paper)

4. **Consider Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL)** for historical literature
   - Extensive digitized collection of historical taxonomic papers
   - Particularly valuable for 19th and early 20th century descriptions

## Technical Implementation Notes

### API Availability
- **ZooBank**: Provides web services for programmatic access
- **IPNI**: Offers web services for plant names
- **MycoBank**: API available for fungal nomenclature
- **GBIF**: Comprehensive APIs for biodiversity data

### Data Integration Challenges
- Different identifier systems across databases
- Varying data quality and completeness
- Historical vs. modern registration requirements
- Cross-referencing between databases not always reliable

### Performance Considerations
- ZooBank queries may be slower than local databases
- Caching essential for frequently accessed species
- Fallback strategies needed for API timeouts
- Rate limiting required to avoid overwhelming services
